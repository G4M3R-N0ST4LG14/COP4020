## Higher Order Functions and Modules

1. Using map, double the numbers in this list: [1,5,-18,99]

2. Using filter extract all the even numbers in this list: [1..100]

3. Using map multiply all numbers in this list: [1,3..77] by 3.

4. Using any functions you choose (but map and filter might be good choices) calculate the sum of the squares of all odd numbers in this list: [1,2,3,4,5,7,8,1,43,25,65,22]
