# COP4020 Haskell Assignment 

## Functions and List Comprehensions Assignment

All of the following will be contained inside of a single .hs file named firstAssignment.hs

1. Create a function that multiplies two numbers

2. Create a function that multiplies three numbers

3. Create a function named first_a that uses a list comprehension. The function will take a single integer parameter n. Find every number from 1 to n (inclusive) that is a multiple of 6 or a multiple of 11. Do not use a helper function.

4. Create a function named first_b that does the same as the function from #3 above, but uses a helper function named isMult6Or11.

5. Create a function named second_a that uses a list comprehension. The function will take a single integer parameter n. Find every number from 1 to n (inclusive) that is a palindrome which starts with the digit 3. Do not user a helper function.

6. Create a function named second_b that does the same as the function from #5 above, but uses a helper function named isPalindromeThatStartsWithDigit3.
